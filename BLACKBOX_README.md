 ### SmartSoft Logo Component

#### Overview
The `Logo` component is a reusable React component that displays the application's logo. It takes two optional props: `onClick` and `variant`. The `onClick` prop is a function that will be called when the logo is clicked. The `variant` prop can be either `"primary"` or `"secondary"`, and it determines the color of the logo text.

#### Installation
To use the `Logo` component, you must first install it from npm:

```bash
npm install @smartsoft/logo
```

Once installed, you can import the component into your React application:

```typescript
import Logo from '@smartsoft/logo';
```

#### Usage

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Logo />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

When the above code is rendered, it will display the application's logo. The logo will be clickable, and when clicked, it will call the `onClick` function (if one is provided).

#### Props

* `onClick`: A function that will be called when the logo is clicked.
